# Download links
The interface can run in multiple operating systems.
* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

Check here for last **stable releases**.

[Check here](https://github.com/bluerobotics/ping-viewer/releases/tag/continuous) for **development releases**.

## Folder structure
Ping-Viewer will create 3 folders under your user documents folder.
 * Windows: `~/My Documents`
 * Mac: `~/Documents`
 * Linux: `~/Documents`
    * **Gui_Log**: Will save all graphic interface logs for debug (*.txt).
    * **Sensor_Log**: Will save all communication made with sensors (*.bin).
    * **Pictures**: Will save all screenshots made with the hotkeys (*.png).
    * **Waterfall_Gradients**: Can be used by the user to create gradients for the waterfall (.txt).

All files follow the same rule for names: YMD-hmsl, for Year(Y), Month(M), Day(D), Hour(h), Minute(m), second(s) and milisecond(l).

## Hotkeys
There is total 3 shortcuts in the interface:
 * **R**: Reset waterfall draw.
 * **S**: Grab a screenshot of the graphic interface.
 * **W**: Grab a screenshot of the waterfall.

## Interface:
The interface has 4 important components:
 1. Chart: Located in the right corner, a vertical plot of signal power per time.
 2. Waterfall: Located in the middle of the interface, a time presentation of the last samples.
    1. It's possible to see previous depth and confidences with the vertical time line reference.
    2. In the right corner a depth axis shows the distance by intervals.
 3. Readout: Widget that shows actual depth and confidence.
 4. Main Menu: Located in the left corner of the interface.

## Main Menu:
With four submenus:
 * Control
 * Settings/Configuration
 * Information
 * Replay

### Control Menu:
![](imgs/arrow_right_black.svg)

It's possible to control:
 * Sensor measurement frequency
 * Auto gain.
 * Manual gain selection.
 * Speed of sound.
 * Minimal distance and length of analysis.

It's also possible to realize the connection configuration if auto connection is not able to find your device.
 * Sensor type (Right now only ping is available).
 * Connection type:
    * Serial.
    * UDP.
    * Simulation.
  * Serial port and baudrate.
  * IP address and port for the UDP connection.

### Settings/Configuration Menu:
![](imgs/settings_black.svg)

The settings menu has 2 submenus:
 * Appearance
 * Firmware updates

![](imgs/settings_submenu.png)

#### Appearance configuration
>Note: The idea here is to define paths to submenus and configurations via symbols:

* Smooth Data
    * Uses a discrete low pass filter with Î±=0.2.
* Antialiasing
    * Indicates that the engine should antialias edges of primitives if possible.
* Debug Mode
    * Enable super powers (_With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility_).

#### User gradients
The user can create his own gradients for the waterfall, for this, it's necessary to create a file that follow some rules inside **Waterfall_Gradients** folder.
1. Filenames need to have .txt extension.
2. Filenames will be used as gradient name.
3. Filenames with underscores will be replaced with spaces.
4. Lines that do not start with # will not be processed.
5. Color values need to follow:
    1. #RGB (each of R, G, and B is a single hex digit)
    2. #RRGGBB
    3. #AARRGGBB
    4. #RRRGGGBBB
    5. #RRRRGGGGBBBB

    There is a very good tool to help with gradient colours [here](http://www.perbang.dk/rgbgradient/).
6. First value will represent 0.0
7. The last value will represent 1.0
8. The value of any other color will be `1.0*((color position) - 1)/(number of colors)`

This is an example of gradient file:
```
; Put this example in a file called `Gradient_test.txt` in **Waterfall_Gradients**.
#000000
#ffffff
#ff0000
```

Where `#000000` is white (low power signal - 0.0), `#ffffff` (average power signal - 0.5) is black and `#ff0000` is red (max power signal - 1.0).

#### Firmware updates
![](imgs/settings_black.svg) ![](imgs/chip_black.svg)

It's possible to set a new firmware in the device.
> Note: This will only work with sensors that are running and working properly. Check your sensor documentation to flash it again if it's bricked.

Steps to flash the device:
1. Connect with it with **Control Menu**.
2. Open **Firmware Update**
    * Check if _Current Firmware_ shows the actual firmware version running in the device.
3. Use the _Browse.._ button to select a new firmware.
4. Click in _FIRMWARE UPDATE_ to start the process.
5. Wait until the process bar is completely full and start the 'waiting state' again.

2. The time bar can be used to control the timestamp.
3. **REPLAY DATA**: Button used to select sensor log.
